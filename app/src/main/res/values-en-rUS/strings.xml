    <string name="strDescripcionArte">Fast-paced match in the first leg of the Champions League semifinals. Manchester City defeated Madrid (4-3) in a fast-paced match, where the English team, leader of the English Premier and coached by Pep Guardiola, came first in this series of semifinals of the competition. However, it could have been much worse for Madrid, who were down 2-0 after 10 minutes and always reacted when City were scoring. Benzema made it 2-1, Vinicius then made it 3-2 and still Benzema, at 4-2, took a Panenka-style penalty to make it 4-3.</string>.
